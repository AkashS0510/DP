# DP

I used normal looping for forming the alignment matrix. Stored the parents as a tuple in a Parent matrix and formed the backtracking by retreiving the parents from this matrix.The time complexity is O(n2). Backtrackibg and Alignment sequence has been generated.
Generated the alignment sequence for the max score sequence.
